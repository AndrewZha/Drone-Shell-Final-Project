# 🦾 Drone Shell
*Final Project CAD model for Advanced CAD Design at FRCC*

---

## 🚀 Overview
- This model was done for the Advanced CAD Design course at FRCC.
- Project prompt was to design using sheet metal, so I chose to use sheet metal as a protective armor for a drone
- Full drone design and sheet metal armor are original designs (13 unique parts in total), and meant to support electronic housing and wire routing
- Emphasis on efficient design AND flexible modularity for future changes
- Many parts were made in top-down assembly, with links to each other to allow for quick updates between all parts when modifying dimensions

## 🧠 Key Features
- 🔹Inner Chassis
  - 🔹3D printable design + wire routing ribs
- 🔹Propellers
  - 🔹Designed from scratch with surface modeling
  - 🔹Part-configurations allow for reverse direction
- 🔹Eletronics Compartment
  - 🔹Designed to be future-proof; only a few dimensions need to be changed to easily account for various electronic configurations
  - 🔹Cutouts lead to inner-chassis and receiver. Also, has cutout for batter compartment
- 🔹Peripherals (motor, landing gear, receiver enclosure, bolts)
  - 🔹All designed to be easily modified in the future with efficient design
  - 🔹changes to dimensions of motor and bolts will update throughout whole assembly
